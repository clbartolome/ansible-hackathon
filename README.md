## Exchange Rates Application

This application consists of two parts:
1. A [backend](exchange-rates-backend/README.md) developed with Flask that provides a REST service to get and update exchange rates.

2. A [frontend](exchange-rates-frontend/README.md) developed with React that consumes the REST service and displays the exchange rates in a graphical interface.
